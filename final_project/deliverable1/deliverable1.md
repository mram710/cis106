## Basic Terminology

### What is a web server? 

The term webserver can refer to either hardware or software or both of them working together.

- For the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files (HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.

- For the software side, a web server includes parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLS and HTTP. An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.

### What is virtualization?

## Important Concepts  

**Systemmd** - is a command that is used to manage system settings and services. Systemd organizes tasks into components called units, and groups of units into targets that can be used to create dependencies on other system services and resources.

**Systemctl** - is a command that is used to interact with processes that are controlled by systemd. It can be used to examine the status of units and targets, as well as start, stop, and reconfigure them.
